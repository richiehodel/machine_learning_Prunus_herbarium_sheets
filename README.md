## This repo holds jupyter notebooks and scripts associated with the manuscript "A phylogenomic approach, combined with morphological characters gleaned via machine learning, uncovers the hybrid origin and biogeographic diversification of the plum genus"

### The notebooks here are meant to walk the reader through the analyses used in the manuscript. By changing directory and variable names, they could be readily modified to be used on different sets of labeled image data.

* The jupyter notebooks are in this repository and available for download and can be run locally on your computer.
However, it is sometimes easier to run them in Google Colab.

Here's a link to open the notebook that trims images in Google Colab:
