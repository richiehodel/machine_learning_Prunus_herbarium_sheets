This repo holds jupyter notebooks and scripts associated with the manuscript "A phylogenomic approach, combined with morphological characters gleaned via machine learning, uncovers the hybrid origin and biogeographic diversification of the plum genus"

* The jupyter notebooks are in this repository and available for download.
However, it is sometimes easier to run them in Google Colab.
Here's a link to open the notebook that trims images in Google Colab:
